This project showcases an innovative approach to pathfinding, implementing [BFS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/breadth-first-search-or-bfs-for-a-graph/), [DLS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/depth-limited-search-for-ai/), and [A* (a-star)](https://medium.com/akatsuki-taiwan-technology/a-pathfinding-algorithm-in-2d-grid-11f5a5354cc2) algorithms to navigate agents Kermit and Piggy through a dynamic, customizable 2D grid environment. Key features include:

+ **Algorithmic Diversity**: Utilizes Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-Limited Search (DLS), and A* (A-Star) for optimal path discovery.
+ **Algorithm Visualization**: Provides clear, graphical representations of search trees, paths and other metrics, enhancing understanding of each algorithm's operation.
+ **Dynamic Environment**: Pseudo-randomly generated 2D grid parameterizable with controls representing various states.
+ **Strategic Movement**: Agents move in a clockwise pattern towards specific targets - Kermit to Elmo's cell, and Piggy to Kermit's position.
+ **Optimization Mechanics**: Piggy's movement cost is halved after capturing a cookie, enhancing A* algorithm efficiency.
+ **Modern Tech Stack**: Implemented using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [React.js](https://react.dev/) for a robust, interactive user interface.
+ **Quality Code**: Adheres to SOLID principles and utilizes design patterns like custom hooks for maintainability and scalability.

Dive into this project to explore the fascinating world of pathfinding algorithms and witness their application in a visually engaging, interactive environment.
